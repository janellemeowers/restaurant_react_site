Responsive fine-dining restaurant website made with React, JS, HTML, CSS. This was great frontend practice to take a free figma file from UI8 (making some minor style changes, like changing fonts and restaurant name), and turn it into a mobile responsive site. 

<b>React</b> is used for the mobile menu state, the photo gallery, reusable components, mapping over menu data and more. Used Create React App for setup.
